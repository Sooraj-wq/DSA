#Java DSA ‚òï
This repository is my personal collection of common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in Java and some solved problems, organized by the relevant DSA concepts. 


###How to Use

You can clone this repository to explore the implementations and solutions on your local machine.
git clone [DSA Link](https://github.com/Sooraj-wq/DSA.git)
Each problem solution is typically a self-contained Java class or method. You can copy the code directly into the LeetCode editor to test it or run it in your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code).
